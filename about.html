        Lexi was born on September 27, 2001, in Whitefish, Montana. Her father
        was in the military at the time so her and her family were only there
        for a few years before moving to Colorado, South Carolina, and then
        finally settling in Nebraska. Lexi’s family consists of her mom, her
        dad, and an older brother. Her family has three pets, two dogs and one
        cat. She went to Kindergarten in South Carolina, otherwise all her
        schooling has come in Nebraska. She graduated high school from Bellevue
        West High School in 2019 and currently attends the University of
        Nebraska-Omaha and is on track to graduated in the spring of 2023 with a
        degree in Elementary Education. In high school, Lexi was the
        editor-in-chief of her schools’ yearbook. In this role she oversaw the
        final product of the yearbook, as well as going out and taking pictures
        for it. Due to her brother playing baseball all her life, her favorite
        thing to photograph was sports, particularly baseball. She is a lover of
        animals. She has had many different pets during her life. Her favorites
        have been her cats, Gracie, and Bella. She had Gracie while she was
        growing up in middle school and high school. Lexi got Bella during the
        middle of the Covid pandemic at
        <a href="https://felius.org/">Felius Cat Cafe</a>. Lexi always goes out
        of her way to help people and animals. She plans on getting a job
        helping others one on one after graduating. She also plans on pursuing a
        master’s degree in a field that would allow her to do help others.
