        Lexi is a very hardworking person. She has been a full-time student at
        UNO and has also worked a part-time job in insurance during most of her
        time in college. She is majoring in elementary education with a
        concentration in school library. While she doesn’t want to be a
        classroom teacher, she wants to help others in a one-on-one setting. She
        is looking over her options and those options include human resources,
        speech pathology, or research and development as of now. Lexi was able
        to join kindergarten a year earlier, so she is usually younger than her
        peers. This fact combined with her hard work and determination have made
        her very successful compared to others her age. In her free time Lexi
        likes to spend time with her boyfriend, unwind with some video games, or
        play with her cat Bella. Lexi is always looking for new experiences to
        share with those around her. She is the queen of finding great new
        restaurants. She has a gaming PC and a Nintendo Switch that you can find
        her playing sims, Pokémon, or MarioKart on. Her favorite activity though
        is playing with her cat, Bella. Bella is a wild and active cat that
        loves to play, but only when it’s with Lexi. Bella’s favorite thing is
        when Lexi swings toys around and Bella jumps and catches them. She also
        has started a Lego collection recently. She has built almost all of the
        botanical collection that Lego offers and has found more sets that she
        would like to build.
